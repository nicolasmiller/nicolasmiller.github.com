Kosmische Privacy Policy
------------------------

Kosmische's codebase currently requires the android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO
permission for compatibility with a dependency that it uses for audio synthesis.
The feature is currently unimplemented and unused. There is no user accessible way to
record audio at this time, and the application itself does not record or store any
audio. Additionally, Kosmische is a completely local application; it does not
communicate with a backend server at all.
